## Understanding the Linux File System Hierachy

In Linux, everything is a file. Configuration are stored in files. Devices are also addressed as files. Directories are highly standarized on linux:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/usr`    | Stands for "User System Resources". Contains user programs, libraries, documentation, and other system-wide files. It's where most of the applications and utilities are installed. |
| `/var`    | Stands for "Variable Files". Contains files to which the system writes data during operation, such as logs, spool files, and temporary files used by various applications. It's dynamic and often changing. |
| `/etc`    | Contains configuration files for the system and applications. This directory holds system-wide configuration files, shell scripts, and service files. Modifications here can change the behavior of the system and its services. |
| `/home`   | Contains personal directories for users. Each user has a directory under `/home`, where they store their personal files, configuration files, and application data. |
| `/tmp`    | Stands for "Temporary Files". A directory for storing temporary files created by applications or the system. Files here are usually deleted at system reboot or after a certain period. |
| `/proc`   | Stands for "Process Information". A virtual filesystem that provides a mechanism to access kernel and process status information. It's dynamically generated by the system and includes details about the system and running processes. |
| `/root`   | The home directory for the root user (the system administrator or superuser). This directory is separate from `/home` and is used specifically for root's personal files and configuration. |
| `/lib`    | Contains essential shared libraries and kernel modules needed for the system to boot and run. These libraries are critical for the functioning of both the system and many user applications. |
| `/bin`    | Stands for "Binary". Contains essential command binaries (programs) that are needed in single-user mode and for basic system functionality. Commands like `ls`, `cp`, and `bash` are typically found here. |

The FHS is the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) by the Linux Foundation. Regular user have access only to `/home` (only in their own) and `/tmp`. The `touch` help to confirm wwheter you have writing access to the directory or not.

The `man hier` page shows details about the FHS.

## Listing Files

The `pwd` help you to find what is your current directory. The `ls` command list files and directories:

| Command          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `ls -a`          | Lists all files and directories, including hidden files (those starting with a dot `.`) in the current directory. Normally, hidden files are not displayed. |
| `ls -l`          | Lists files and directories in long format, providing detailed information such as file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and the last modified date and time. |
| `ls -ld /directory` | Lists the directory itself in long format, rather than its contents. This shows detailed information about the directory specified (`/directory` in this case) without listing the files within it. |
| `ls -lrt`        | Lists files and directories in long format, sorted by modification time, with the oldest entries first. This is useful for viewing files in chronological order, from oldest to newest. |

## Wildcards

Most file-oriented commands support using wildcards:

| Command                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `ls a*`                | Lists all files and directories in the current directory whose names start with the letter 'a'. The `*` wildcard matches any number of characters following 'a'. |
| `ls a?*`               | Lists all files and directories in the current directory whose names start with 'a' and have at least one more character following 'a'. The `?` wildcard matches exactly one character after 'a'. |
| `ls a[nm]*`            | Lists all files and directories in the current directory whose names start with 'a' followed by either 'n' or 'm'. The `*` wildcard allows for any number of characters after 'a[nm]'. |
| `ls a[a-e]*`           | Lists all files and directories in the current directory whose names start with 'a' followed by any character from 'a' to 'e'. The `*` wildcard matches any number of characters after 'a[a-e]'. |
| `touch file{1..100}`   | Creates 100 files named `file1`, `file2`, ..., `file100` in the current directory. The `{1..100}` sequence expands to numbers from 1 to 100. |
| `mkdir /data/{sales,account}` | Creates two directories named `sales` and `account` inside the `/data` directory. The `{sales,account}` expansion creates both directories in a single command. |

## Change, create and delete directories

| Command     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `cd`        | Stands for "change directory". This command is used to change the current working directory to the specified directory. For example, `cd /home/user` will change the current directory to `/home/user`. Using `cd` without any arguments will change the current directory to the user's home directory. |
| `mkdir`     | Stands for "make directory". This command creates a new directory with the specified name. For example, `mkdir newfolder` creates a directory named `newfolder` in the current location. |
| `mkdir -p`  | Creates a directory and any necessary parent directories. For example, `mkdir -p /home/user/projects/newfolder` will create the `projects` and `newfolder` directories if they do not already exist. This is useful for creating nested directories in one command. |
| `rmdir`     | Stands for "remove directory". This command deletes an empty directory. For example, `rmdir emptyfolder` removes the directory named `emptyfolder` if it is empty. It will not delete a directory that contains files or other directories. |
| `rmdir -p`  | Removes a directory and its parent directories if they are empty. For example, `rmdir -p /home/user/projects/newfolder` will remove `newfolder`, `projects`, and `user` directories if each of them is empty. This is useful for cleaning up multiple levels of empty directories. |

Path names can be:

 * Absolute paths that contain the full name from the root directory to a file
   * This is recommended to avoid confusion
 * Relative path is related to the current directory and contains the rest that is needed to get to a file
   * In relative paths, you can use `../` that means "one directory up"

## Copy, Remove and Move Files

| Command    | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `cp`       | Stands for "copy". This command copies files or directories from one location to another. For example, `cp source.txt destination.txt` copies `source.txt` to `destination.txt`. If copying a directory, you must use the `-R` or `-a` option. |
| `cp -a`    | Stands for "archive". This command copies files and directories along with their attributes such as permissions, ownership, timestamps, and symbolic links. It creates an exact duplicate of the source. It's equivalent to `cp -dR --preserve=all`. |
| `cp -R`    | Stands for "recursive". This command copies directories and their contents recursively. It copies the entire directory tree, including all files and subdirectories. For example, `cp -R dir1 dir2` copies the directory `dir1` to `dir2`. |
| `mv`       | Stands for "move". This command moves files or directories from one location to another. It can also be used to rename files or directories. For example, `mv oldname.txt newname.txt` renames `oldname.txt` to `newname.txt`, or `mv file.txt /new/location/` moves `file.txt` to the specified location. |
| `rm`       | Stands for "remove". This command deletes files. For example, `rm file.txt` deletes `file.txt`. It does not delete directories unless used with the `-r` option. |
| `rm -i`    | Stands for "interactive". This command prompts for confirmation before each file deletion. For example, `rm -i file.txt` will ask for confirmation before deleting `file.txt`. This is useful for preventing accidental deletions. |
| `rm -f`    | Stands for "force". This command forces the deletion of files, ignoring non-existent files and never prompting for confirmation. For example, `rm -f file.txt` will delete `file.txt` without asking, even if the file is write-protected. |
| `rm -r`    | Stands for "recursive". This command deletes directories and their contents recursively. For example, `rm -r dir` will delete `dir` and all of its files and subdirectories. |
| `rm -rf`   | Combines "force" and "recursive". This command forcefully and recursively deletes directories and their contents without prompting for confirmation. For example, `rm -rf dir` will delete `dir` and everything inside it without any prompts. This command should be used with caution. |
