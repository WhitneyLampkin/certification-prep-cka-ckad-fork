## Introduction

This lesson it is cover how to create clusters with `kubeadm`. We will review the cluster node requirements and network requirements, what happen when we initialize the cluster and how to install the cluster and how to use `kubeadm init`, as well as adding nodes to the cluster and configuring the Kubernetes client.

## Node and Network Requirements

### ⭐ Node Requirements

To install a a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm` we need at least two nodes with the following requirements:

 - A recent version of Ubuntu or CentOS
 - 2 GiB RAM or more
 - 2 CPUs r more on the control-plane node
 - Network conectivity between the nodes

We also need to install the following:
 - A container runtime
 - The Kubernetes tools

The container runtime allow you to run containers in the operating system. Some runtimes are containerd, CRI-O, Docker Engine, etc... In the CKA exam is not required to install a container runtime as it will be already installed.

The Kubernetes tool includes the following:
 - `kubeadm`: Used to install and manage a Kubernetes cluster
 - `kubelet`: The core Kubernetes service that starts all Pods
 - `kubectl`: The interface that allows you to run and manage applications in Kubernetes

You don't need to install the Kubernetes tools in the CKA exam.

### ⭐ Network Requirements

Different types of network communicates are used in Kubernetes:
 - Node communication: Handled by the physical network
 - External-to-Service communication: Handled by the Kubernetes Service resources
 - Pod-to-Service communication: Hnandled by the Kybernetes Services
 - Pod-to-Pod communication: Handled by the network plugin
 - Container-to-Container: Handled within the containers of a Pod

To create the software defined Pod network, a network add-on is needed. This is provided by the Kubernetes ecosystem that is not included in Vanilla Kubernetes. Kubernetes provides a Container Network Interface (CNI), that is generic interface that allows different plugins to be used. Depending on the plug-in you use, different features are included such as network policies, IPv6 support or Role Base Access Control (RBAC).

The most common network add-ons are:

 - **Calico**: The most common that support all relevant features
 - **Flannel**: Generic and used in the past, doesnt support Network Policy
 - **Multus**: This plugin can work with multiple plugins and it is the default in OpenShift
 - **Weave**: Another common add-on that does support commn features

## Cluster Initialization and kubeadmin utilization

### ⭐ Initialization Phases

When you run `kubeadm init`, multiple phases are executed:

 1. **Preflight**: Ensure that all conditions are met and core container images are downloaded
 1. **Certificates**: A self-signed Kubernetes CA is generated, and related certificates are created for `apiserver`, `etcd` and `proxy`
 1. **kubeconfig**: Configuration files are generated for core Kubernetes services
 1. **kubelet-start**: The `kubelet` is started
 1. **control-plane**: Static `Pod` manifests are created and started for `apiserver`, control manager and `scheduler`
 1. **etcd**: Static `Pod` manifest is created and started for `etcd`
 1. **upload-config**: `ConfigMaps` are created for `ClusterConfiguration` and `kubelet` component config
 1. **upload-certs**: uploads all certificates to `/etc/kubernetes/pki`
 1. **mark-control-plane**: Marks the node as control plane
 1. **bootstrap-token**: Generates the token that can be used to join other nodes
 1. **kubelet-finalize**: Finalizes the kubelet settings.
 1. **add-on**: Installs `coredns` and `kube-proxy` add-ons

### ⭐ Steps to install cluster

 1. Install the container runtime
 1. Install the kubetools
 1. Install the clusters: `sudo kubeadm init`
 1. Set up the client (commands provided in step 3):
    - `mkdir ~/.kube`
    - `sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf ~/.kube/config`
    - `sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) .kube/config`
 1. Install the network add-on:
    - `kubectl create -f <network-add-on-manifest>`
 1. Join other nodes (commands provided in step 3):
    - `sudo kubeadm join <join-token>`

### ⭐ kubeadm usage

While using `kubeadm init`, different arguments can be used to further define the cluster:

 - `--apiserver-advertise-address`: The IP address on which the API server is listening
 - `--config`: Contains a configuration file for additional configurations
 - `--dry-run`: Performs a dry-run before actually installing for real
 - `--pod-network-cidr`: sets the CIDR used for the Pod network
 - `--service-cidr`: sets the service CIDR to something other than `10.96.0.0/12`
 - `reset`: It will do best effort to revert changes made to this host by `kubeadm init` or `kubeadm join`

In most scenarios, running `kubeadm init` should be enough.

### ⭐ Add nodes

When Kubernetes cluster is initialized, a join token is generated. Use this koin token to other hosts using `sudo kubeadm join` from the host you want to join.

If token is lost or expired, you can create a new one:

```
sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```

### ⭐ Configure the Kubernetes client

Another important part is to configure the client. You can copy the `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` file to `~/.kube/config` to provide admin access to the kubernetes cluster. You can also use `export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf`.

For more advanced user configuration, users must be created and provided with authorizations using RBAC.

The contex groups client access parameters using a convenient name. By selecting a context, a specific gorup of parameters can be access. Each context has the following parameters:

  - Cluster: The cluster you want to connect to. The cluster is debined by its endpoint and the certificate and its keys. You can use following command to define a cluster:
  ```
kubectl config --kubeconfig=~/.kube/config set-cluster <cluster-name> --server=<server-address> --certificate-authority=<cert>
  ```
  - Namespace: The namespace is the default namespace defined in this context.
  - User: The user is the user account, defined by its X.509 certificates or other. You can define a user as following:
  ```
  kubectl config --kubeconfig=~/.kube/config set-credentials <user-name> --client-certificate=<cert> --client-key=<key>
  ```

To view the context use `kubectl config view` and to yse a specific context `kubectl use-context`. To create a new context use:

```
kubectl set-context <context-name> --cluster=<cluster-name> --namespace=<namespace> --user=<user-name>
```
