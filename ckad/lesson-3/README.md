## Introduction

In this lesson, we will delve into the origins of Kubernetes, its core functions, architecture, management interfaces, and the essential Kubernetes API. This lesson also covers how to run Kubernetes on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Kubernetes is built upon Borg, Google's internal compute orchestrator. Borg also served as the foundation for several Linux kernel features used in containers, such as namespaces and cgroups. Google donated the Borg specifications to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which initiated the development of Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is a remarkable open-source success story because it comprises a high-quality ecosystem that other companies would struggle to develop individually. Instead, they collaborate to enhance it, and all parties benefit from these collective efforts.

## Kubernetes Core Functions

Kubernetes is an open-source solution for automating deployments, scaling, and managing containerized applications in Cloud Native Computing environments, where applications are hosted in the cloud and have no direct relation to servers. This means that everything the app needs is hosted in the cloud. Kubernetes provides resources defined in the Kubernetes API.

Kubernetes is an ecosystem, not a product. It provides core solutions with many third-party add-ons offered by approved projects. The solutions it offers include network, ingress, monitoring, packaging, and more.

Kubernetes is a project of CNCF, an open-source foundation within the Linux Foundation, making it available to everyone and every company. Thanks to its open-source nature, companies use a common and robust codebase, allowing them to focus on developing the features they need. Kubernetes has some competition, such as Mesos or Docker Swarm, but they are not as popular. Kubernetes has several distributions, including Vanilla Kubernetes (maintained by CNCF), as well as others like Google Anthos, Red Hat OpenShift, SUSE Rancher, and Canonical Kubernetes, but they are all based on Vanilla.

Kubernetes releases updates every three months, and new versions of the API may become available. These versions might deprecate some features and introduce new ones. If a feature is deprecated, it will be phased out after two more releases, and you will need to update your applications accordingly.

## Kubernetes Management Interfaces

The Kubernetes Application Programming Interface (API) is used to provide access to everything needed to run containers in cloud-native environments, and it standardizes access to Kubernetes resources. Some interfaces to interact with the API are:

The `kubectl` command-line utility provides convenient developer access for your applications. For CKAD, `kubectl` is the only interface used.
You can also use direct API access via HTTP, such as using tools like `curl` or programming language libraries.
The Kubernetes Web Dashboard can be installed to run on the Kubernetes master node. Cloud providers also have their own custom Kubernetes Dashboards.
`kubectl` allows you to manage everything in a Kubernetes environment, and all the available options can be found using `kubectl --help`.

To run an application, use the command `kubectl create deployment myapp --image=myimage`, where myimage is an actual container image. The command `kubectl get all` will list all the resources that have been created.

## Kubernetes Architecture

A Kubernetes cluster has the following components:


 - ***Containerd***: Containerd is a container runtime that manages the execution and lifecycle of containers on a Kubernetes node.
 - ***Kubelet***: Kubelet is the Kubernetes node agent responsible for ensuring that containers are running in a Pod and communicating with the control plane.
 - ***Scheduler***: The Scheduler is responsible for placing Pods on suitable nodes in the cluster based on resource requirements, constraints, and policies.
 - ***API Server***: The API Server is the central control point for the Kubernetes cluster, serving the Kubernetes API and acting as the gateway for various Kubernetes components to interact with the cluster.
 - ***Controller Manager***: The Controller Manager manages various controller processes that regulate the state of the system, ensuring the desired state of resources is maintained.
 - ***etcd***: etcd is a distributed key-value store used as the backing store for all cluster data and provides consistent and reliable storage of configuration data and state information for a Kubernetes cluster.

The **controller node** hosts all these services, while **worker nodes** only host Containerd and Kubelet.

## Essential API Resources

To run applications in Kubernetes, several API resources are provided. Each API resource enhances the functionality of running applications and is essential for identifying the resources we use for our application. Since we don't directly associate resources with a specific server, all the resource information is accessible via the API. Here is a list of some essential API resources in Kubernetes:

| Resource | Description |
|-|-|
| `Deployment` | Deployments are higher-level resources that manages the deployment and scaling of Pods, ensuring that a specified number of replicas are maintained and providing updates and rollbacks for application changes.
| `ReplicaSet` | Replica sets are lower-level resources that ensures a specified number of replica Pods are running at all times to maintain the desired state, used by Deployments and other controllers.
| `Pod` | Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a running process and encapsulating one or more containers, along with their shared storage and network resources.

A full list of resources available in Kubernetes can be obtained by running `kubectl api-resources`. The list is provided along with the API version, and it's important to note that core resources are in the `v1` API. Since Kubernetes is extensible, you will find an extensive list of resources coming from other APIs, such as `apps/v1`, which includes `Deployment` and `ReplicaSet`.

Containers are not managed directly by the Kubernetes API; instead, they are managed by a Pod that is attached to a volume. Replica Sets manage multiple replicas of a Pod running the same application, while Deployments handle the management of Replica Sets. Services are another type of resource that exposes the application to the internet and can be attached to other resources. ConfigMaps and Secrets are additional resource types attached to Pods for separating configurations from containers and distributing the same configuration across multiple Pods.
